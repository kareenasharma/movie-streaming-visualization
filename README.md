Teammates: Laura Wiseman (@laurawiseman) and Kareena Sharma 

About:
Users can use this interactive visualization to help them pick a movie to watch which is available on their streaming platform of choice. This visualization also allows users to compare the movie selections available between various streaming platforms. 

Instructions:
- To start our visualization, navigate into this folder on Terminal (for Mac) or command line (for Windows)
- Run "python -m http.server" to start your local server 
    ** Note: if this doesn't work, you may have an older version of python installed and may need to run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" instead
- Go to localhost:8000 on a webbrowser (Google Chrome is best but Safari works as well)
- Click on the file "assingment3.html" to start the visualization
